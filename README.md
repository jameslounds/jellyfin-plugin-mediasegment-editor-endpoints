# Jellyfin Plugin Media Segments Editor Endpoints
This plugin adds the endpoints [`segment-editor`](https://github.com/endrl/segment-editor) uses
so users can create, edit, and delete media segments.

If there is actual demand for this, I will probably add a manifest.json, but for now, to use the plugin,
build it manually and copy it over to the jellyfin plugins directory.
